Overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Page 1: HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the backbone of web development, providing the basic structure of a webpage. It is a markup language used to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets (< >) to define content.

Key Features of HTML:

Structure: Defines the framework of a webpage with elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <section>.
Semantic Elements: Introduced in HTML5, these include tags like <article>, <aside>, and <main>, which improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
Attributes: Enhance elements with additional properties, such as id, class, and alt for images.
Forms: Facilitate user interaction through input fields, buttons, and dropdowns.
HTML lays the foundation, but by itself, it lacks styling and interactivity. This is where CSS and JavaScript come in.

Page 2: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a stylesheet language used to style and format the visual presentation of HTML elements. It separates content from design, making websites more maintainable and visually appealing.

Key Features of CSS:

Selectors: Define the elements to style, such as element selectors (p), class selectors (.classname), or ID selectors (#id).
Properties and Values: Control aspects like color, font size, margin, padding, and layout. For example:
css
Copy code
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
Box Model: Determines the space an element occupies, including content, padding, border, and margin.
Responsive Design: Media queries and units like %, em, and vh allow designs to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
CSS Frameworks: Tools like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS simplify styling with pre-designed components.
CSS transforms static HTML into visually dynamic webpages, creating an engaging user experience.

Page 3: JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. It is widely supported across browsers and integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS.

Key Features of JavaScript:

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically update content, structure, and styles using the Document Object Model (DOM). Example:
javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
Event Handling: Respond to user actions like clicks, keystrokes, and form submissions using event listeners.
Asynchronous Programming: Manage tasks like fetching data from APIs using promises, async/await, and AJAX.
Client-Side Validation: Validate form inputs to enhance user experience before sending data to the server.
Integration with Libraries and Frameworks: Leverage tools like React, Vue, or Angular to build complex applications efficiently.
JavaScript makes websites interactive and dynamic, powering modern web applications from animations to real-time data updates.

In Summary
HTML provides structure, CSS styles the content, and JavaScript adds interactivity, forming the core triad of web development. Mastering these technologies allows developers to create engaging, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
